<!--Seems like partial has become a storage space. These buttons were pulled
from the other templates and replaced with for fields. Will likely end up deleted-->

<button data-id="{{@index}}" id="test" class="btn btn-default destroy">Remove From Favorites</button>

<button data-id="{{@index}}" id="test2" class="btn btn-default destroy">Remove From Favorites</button>

<input type="integer" name="movie[id]" placeholder="Delete movie by ID">
<!--I have a theory that my for problem could be solved with an injection of {{movie.id}} into movie[id]-->
